In this step, you will examine the JSON-formatted SSTable data  generated by `sstabledump`.

Remember the table definition:

```
CREATE TABLE orders (
  customer text,
  order_id int,
  amount int,
  status text static,
  PRIMARY KEY ((customer), order_id)
);
```

This table has a compound primary key.
The partition key is the `customer` column, and the clustering column is `order_id`.
The `status` column is static, the only *ordinary* column is `amount`.

These are the rows in the `LumaCore` partition.
![LumaCore](https://killrcoda-file-store.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/AC220/Lab03/lumacore.jpg)

Look at the JSON output.
You should see two `partiton` entries. one for *LumaCore* and one for *Nexora*.
Take look at the *LumaCore* parition.
You see that he `key` is `LumaCore`.

```
"partition" : {
  "key" : [ "LumaCore" ],
  "position" : 0
},
```

Next there is a JSON array called `rows`.
The first element isn't really a row, it's a `static_block`.
This data is shared by all the rows in the partition.
There is only one static cell (column) in the `cells` array.
This is the `status` column and its value is `GOLD`.

```
{
  "type" : "static_block",
  "position" : 36,
  "cells" : [
    {"name" : "status", "value" : "GOLD"}
  ]
}
```

The rest of the `rows` array consists of three elements, on for each row in the partition.
Each `row` has a `clustering` array.
In this table the array has only one member, because the table only has one clustering column: `order_id`.

Each `row` also has a `cells` array.
This is for (non-static) columns that are not part of the primary key.
This table only has one such column: `amount`.

```
{
  "type" : "row",
  "position" : 36,
  "clustering" : [ 1410 ],
  "liveness_info" : { "tstamp" : "2025-05-10T04:50:42.604005Z" },
  "cells" : [
    { "name" : "amount", "value" : 1021200 }
  ]
},
{
  "type" : "row",
  "position" : 50,
  "clustering" : [ 1411 ],
  "liveness_info" : { "tstamp" : "2025-05-10T04:50:42.616385Z" },
  "cells" : [
    { "name" : "amount", "value" : 987100 }
  ]
},
{
  "type" : "row",
  "position" : 65,
  "clustering" : [ 1412 ],
  "liveness_info" : { "tstamp" : "2025-05-10T04:50:42.626721Z" },
  "cells" : [
    { "name" : "amount", "value" : 509200 }
  ]
}
```
