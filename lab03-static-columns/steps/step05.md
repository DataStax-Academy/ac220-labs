In this step, you will examine the JSON-formatted SSTable data  generated by `sstabledump`.

Remember the table definition:

```
CREATE TABLE orders (
  customer text,
  order_id int,
  amount int,
  status text static,
  PRIMARY KEY ((customer), order_id)
);
```

This table has a compound primary key.
The partition key is the `customer` column, and the clustering column is `order_id`.
The `status` column is static, the only *ordinary* column is `amount`.

Look at the JSON output.
You should see two `partiton` entries. one for *LumaCore* and one for *Nexora*.

```
"partition" : {
  "key" : [ "LumaCore" ],
  "position" : 0
},
```

```
"partition" : {
  "key" : [ "Nexora" ],
  "position" : 0
},
```
