In this step, you will examine the JSON-formatted SSTable data  generated by `sstabledump`.

Remember the table definition:

```
CREATE TABLE orders (
  customer text,
  order_id int,
  amount int,
  status text static,
  PRIMARY KEY ((customer), order_id)
);
```

This table has a compound primary key.
The partition key is the `customer` column, and the clustering column is `order_id`.
The `status` column is static, the only *ordinary* column is `amount`.

Look at the JSON output.
You should see two `partiton` entries. one for *LumaCore* and one for *Nexora*.
Take look at the *LumaCore* parition.
You see that he `key` is `LumaCore`.

```
"partition" : {
  "key" : [ "LumaCore" ],
  "position" : 0
},
```

Next there s a JSON array called `rows`.
The first element isn't really a row, it's a `static_block`.
This data is shared by all the rows in the partition.
There is only one static cell (column) in the `cells` array.
This is the `status` column and its value is `GOLD`.

```
{
  "type" : "static_block",
  "position" : 36,
  "cells" : [
    {"name" : "status", "value" : "GOLD"}
  ]
}
```
